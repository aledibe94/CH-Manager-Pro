# 🎸 CH Manager Pro
### The Automated Song Manager for Clone Hero on Steam Deck & Linux

![Splash Screen](icons/splash.png)


## 📖 About
**CH Manager Pro** is a native Linux/GTK4 utility designed to automate the tedious process of managing a Clone Hero song library. 
Built specifically with **Steam Deck** users in mind, it works in the background to detect, extract, and install song packs immediately after you download them.

## 🤔 Why use this instead of Bridge?
While **Bridge** is a fantastic tool for browsing Chorus, **CH Manager Pro** fills a different niche: **Background Automation**.

| Feature | Bridge | CH Manager Pro |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Workflow** | Active Storefront (Search & Click) | **Invisible Warehouse Worker** (Zero-Click) |
| **Sources** | Tied to Chorus/Enchor APIs | **Source Agnostic** (Drive, Discord, Web, Any Link) |
| **Files** | Installs chart | **Installs & Backups** original archives |
| **Look & Feel**| Cross-platform style | **Native Linux/GTK4** (Matches SteamOS) |

Use **CH Manager Pro** if you download massive song packs, use external sources (like spreadsheets or Discord), or want a tool that "just works" while you browse.

## ✨ Key Features
* 👀 **Auto-Monitor:** Watches your `Downloads` folder in real-time.
* 📦 **Universal Extraction:** Handles `.zip`, `.rar`, and `.7z` automatically.
* 🛡️ **Safe Mode:** Scans archives for executables or unsafe files before installing.

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
* A Steam Deck (SteamOS) or a Linux Distro (GNOME/GTK4 recommended).
* Dependencies are handled by the script, but you usually need `python3` and `zenity`.

### How to Install
1.  Download the latest release from the **[Releases]** tab (Download the Source Code zip).
2.  Extract the folder.
3.  Ensure the `icons` folder is next to the `installer.sh` script.

## 🤖 Built with AI-Assisted Engineering
This project is an experiment in **Human-AI Collaboration**.
* **The Architect:** Defined the logic, UI/UX design, and safety protocols.
* **The Coder:** The Python/GTK4 code was generated by AI based on strict prompt engineering.

## 🛑 Project Status & Contributions
**Status: Feature Complete / Maintenance Mode.**

I built this tool to solve a specific problem I had. It works perfectly for my needs, so **I do not plan to release further updates.**

However, this is **Open Source**!
* **Fork it:** Feel free to modify the code, improve the logic, or fix bugs.
* **Windows Port:** The core logic is Python. If you want to create a Windows version, **you have my full permission.**
